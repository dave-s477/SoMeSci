# **SoMeSci**: **So**ftware **Me**ntions in **Sci**entific Articles

SoMeSci is a manually labelled corpus of Software Mentions in scientific articles.
Overall, it contains 3756 software annotations in 1367 articles.
Moreover, additional information (version, extension, release, developer, url, license, citation, abbreviation, alternative name) associated with the software is annotated and linked to the software by relations. 
For an exact configuration of the annotation take a look in the `conf` folder. 
Annotated texts are given as BRAT stand-off format in `PLoS_methods`, `PLoS_sentences`, `Pubmed_fulltext`, and `Creation_sentences`. 
All annotations of software, citations, developers, and licenses are also linked through provided unique identifiers in the folder `Linking`.
