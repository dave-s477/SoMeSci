Consistent with RÃ©sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [11], each of the obtained 384 self-reported intensity profiles following negative feedback was first transformed into a function using the linear interpolation function (interp1) implemented in MATLAB R2016b [38] and then discretised into 44 equally distanced time points, corresponding to the number of images acquired during the period that participants read and thought about the feedback. These time series were subsequently decomposed into two components using non-negative matrix factorization [39] (as implemented in MATLAB R2016b [38]).
