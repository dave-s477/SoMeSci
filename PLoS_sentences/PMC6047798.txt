Based on two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a two-tail test Î± of 5% with 80% power, it was estimated that at least 96 mother-child pairs would be required to detect a 20% difference in the mean duration of ABF between the intervention and control groups (POWER procedure, SAS Version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

All the statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
