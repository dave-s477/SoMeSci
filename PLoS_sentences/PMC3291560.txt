The influence of branch length and earthworm choices on earthworm times to choose was studied with a general linear model test with 2 factors (Minitab® v15.0, α = 5%). For group-joining assays in the circular arena, a chi-square test for independence (Minitab® v15.0, N = 46, df = 2, α = 5%) was used to compare the number of earthworms reaching the central region when different numbers of earthworms were presented there. A general linear model with 1 factor (Minitab® v15.0, α = 5%) was used to compare times to initial movement and times to trial completion (when earthworm reached the central region or the edge of the arena) when different numbers of earthworms were presented.
