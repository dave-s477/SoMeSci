We used general linear models to determine if colony and patriline have a significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of a worker’s hemolymph using the GLM procedure in SAS Ver. 4. We also conducted nested analysis of variance to estimate the variance component associated with patriline and colony, using the NESTED procedure in SAS. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between patrilines were conducted using Tukey’s HSD function in R version 3.0.1 [43].
