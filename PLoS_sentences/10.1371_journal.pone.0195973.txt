The hypothesized relationships were assessed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS [62] with Model 5, which estimates the indirect effect of X (Job characteristics) on Y (Psychological Work Ability/Job mobility Intentions) through the mediator M (Motivational Orientations), with a moderating role played by W (Age) in the X → Y (Job characteristics → Psychological Work Ability/Job mobility Intentions) relationship.
