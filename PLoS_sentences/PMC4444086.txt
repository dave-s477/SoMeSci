Reliability analysis of the data and univariate analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows, and the SEM was produced using LISREL 8.5. Ï‡2, RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation), SRMR (standardized root mean square residual), GFI (goodness-of-fit index), AGFI (adjusted goodness-of-fit index), and IFI (incremental fit index) were used to indicate whether the model was an adequate fit [34].
