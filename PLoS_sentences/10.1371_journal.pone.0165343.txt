All images were acquired through the Matlab Image Acquisition Toolbox (Mathworks, Matlab v2011b) at 2 frames/s (500 ms exposure) at 360x260 pixel (px) resolutions (using 4x4 hardware binning). The images were subsequently processed and analyzed on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox (Mathworks, Matlab v2011b) using script modified from Theyel and colleagues [20].
