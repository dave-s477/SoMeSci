Instead, we applied a custom built MATLAB routine (using the speech processing toolbox ‘voicebox’ in MATLAB v. R2014a) to extract acoustic ‘features’ (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; MFCCs) from single screams and chorus excerpts. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS (version 21, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.).
