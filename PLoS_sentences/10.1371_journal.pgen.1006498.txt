[72], probes not rated as “perfect” (50 out of 50 nucleotides match the reference genome) or “good” (48 to 49 out of 50 matches to the genome) were removed; so were probes that mapped to more than one genomic location according to BLAST queries[73] and probes that included a SNP (NCBI dbSNP Build 137); finally, only probes detected in at least 5% of the mice at a 0.95 detection level (as per GenomeStudio) were retained.
