The experiment was programmed with the Experiment Builder Software (version 1.10.1630; SR Research Ltd., Ottawa, Canada) and data processing and analysis was performed using the open-source statistical programming language R (www.r-project.org) and Matlab® R2011b (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The GBVS algorithm is available as Matlab® source code, it is applicable without initial training and it performs well in predicting fixations in free viewing conditions [20,21].
