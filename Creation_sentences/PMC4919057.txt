To fill this gap, we developed a web-based application, QuIN, which enables: 1) building and visualizing chromatin interaction networks, 2) annotating networks with user-provided private and publicly available functional genomics and interaction datasets, 3) querying network components based on gene name or chromosome location, and 4) utilizing network based measures to identify and prioritize critical regulatory targets and their direct and indirect interactions.
AVAILABILITY: QuINâ€™s web server is available at http://quin.jax.org QuIN is developed in Java and JavaScript, utilizing an Apache Tomcat web server and MySQL database and the source code is available under the GPLV3 license available on GitHub: https://github.com/UcarLab/QuIN/.
To overcome the limitations of current tools, we developed a single platform for Querying and visualizing Chromatin Interaction Networks (QuIN) (http://quin.jax.org) (Fig 1).
In summary, QuIN is designed to enable biologists to easily represent and annotate their chromatin-interaction datasets in the form of networks and to use these datasets for discovering important interactions or targets.
QuIN is an open source project released under the GNU General Public License Version 3 and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/UcarLab/QuIN/) and in S1 software.
