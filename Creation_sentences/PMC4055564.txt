We present CGBayesNets, a BN package focused around prediction of a clinical phenotype from mixed discrete and continuous variables, which fills these gaps.
CGBayesNets provides a full suite of functions for model exploration and verification, including cross validation, bootstrapping, and AUC manipulation.
CGBayesNets is implemented in MATLAB and available as MATLAB source code, under an Open Source license and anonymous download at http://www.cgbayesnets.com.
CGBayesNets provides functions for making testing on multiple different datasets simple and direct.
The CGBayesNets package is available from the authors and via anonymous download from www.cgbayesnets.com.
