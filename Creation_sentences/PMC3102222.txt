ProDySummary: We developed a Python package, ProDy, for structure-based analysis of protein dynamics.
Availability: ProDy is open source and freely available under GNU General Public License from http://www.csb.pitt.edu/ProDy/.
We developed ProDy to analyze and retrieve biologically significant information from such heterogeneous structural datasets.
In ProDy, we implemented algorithms for optimal alignment of such heterogeneous datasets and building corresponding covariance matrices.
