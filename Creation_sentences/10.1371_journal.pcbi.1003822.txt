With Pep2Path, we introduce a software package to fully automate the peptidogenomics approach through the rapid Bayesian probabilistic matching of mass spectra to their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters.
Finally, we can also add an η variable that allows NRPSPredictor2 mismatches to be penalized exponentially as the number of mismatches increase:The default value in the Pep2Path software is η = 2.
Pep2Path is freely available from http://pep2path.sourceforge.net/, implemented in Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 and supported on MS Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
Updated versions of the Pep2Path code will be made available on http://pep2path.sourceforge.net in the future.
