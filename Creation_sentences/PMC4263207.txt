This work presents Constraint-based Flux Analysis (CBFA), an open-source software application for flux analysis in metabolic models that implements several methods for phenotype prediction, allowing users to define constraints associated with measured fluxes and/or flux ratios, together with environmental conditions (e.g. media) and reaction/gene knockouts.
The integration of CBFA within the OptFlux framework for ME enables the utilization of different model formats and standards and the integration with complementary methods for phenotype simulation and visualization of results.
In this work, CBFA - Constraint-based Flux Analysis, a general-purpose and flexible application is proposed that is independent of the type of data available and their processing.
In order to explore several features for model handling and visualization, and to enable the interaction with different tools, CBFA was built as a new plugin for Optflux.
An overview of the overall workflow implemented in CBFA is provided in Figure [1], where the different inputs, the generated constraints, the system types, the supported methods and their outputs are shown.
