Here we present PhyloGibbs-MP, an extension of PhyloGibbs in several directions that go well beyond standard motif-finding.
PhyloGibbs-MP can localise predictions to small modules, not known a priori, in large quantities of input sequence.
PhyloGibbs-MP is available at http://www.imsc.res.in/âˆ¼rsidd/phylogibbs-mp/.
