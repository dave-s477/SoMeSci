To fill this void, we have developed the illuminaio package that parses IDAT files from any BeadArray platform, including the decryption of files from Illuminaâ€™s gene expression arrays. illuminaio provides the first open-source package for this task, and will promote wider uptake of the IDAT format as a standard for sharing Illumina BeadArray data in public databases, in the same way that the CEL file serves as the standard for the Affymetrix platform.
Implementation illuminaio is an R package [9].
Software availability illuminaio is an R package available from the Bioconductor project ( http://www.bioconductor.org) and from http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7588.
The article describes illuminaio, an R package to process the raw data files produced by the Illumina scanning software.
