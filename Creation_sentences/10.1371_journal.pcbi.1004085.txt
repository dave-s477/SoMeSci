In 2008, we presented the first version of our pathway visualization and analysis tool PathVisio [1].
PathVisio is implemented in Java and thus runs on all major operating systems.
The PathVisio repository is located at http://repository.pathvisio.org.
To enable the integration of PathVisio in an automated workflow, we developed PathVisioRPC (http://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/pathvisiorpc/) to be able to call PathVisio from other programming languages through an XML-RPC server.
