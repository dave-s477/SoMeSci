We have developed ANDES, a software library and a suite of applications, written in Perl and R, for the statistical ANalyses of DEep Sequencing.
The applications we have implemented in ANDES allow an investigator to identify and compare the variations within a sample or among multiple samples.
To identify the nature of sequencing artifacts and how they may impact the analyses of a 16S metagenomic sample, ANDES was applied to compute empirically-determined quality values on a set of 454 Titanium sequencing runs.
