Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data.
Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

Because such approach has, to our knowledge, not been adapted for mapping MEA data, here we present NeuroMap, an interactive Matlab-based software for mapping MEA data based on spline interpolation.
NeuroMap has been used on real LFP data recorded from embryonic mouse brainstem and spinal cord preparations.

For this purpose, an image warping tool was implemented in NeuroMap, based on a moving least squares algorithm employing rigid transformations for a realistic deformation (Schaefer et al., 2006).

We presented NeuroMap, an interactive software for spatiotemporal mapping of 2D and 3D MEA data.
