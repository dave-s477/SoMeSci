To address this need, we propose a novel reactive coarse-grained force field, as well as a publicly available software package, named the Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active Networks (MEDYAN), for simulating active network evolution and dynamics (available at www.medyan.org).
The MEDYAN model has been implemented in a C++ software package which uses efficient data structures and object-oriented programming paradigms to simulate active networks with the scheme described in the earlier sections.
Our public software implementation of MEDYAN (available at www.medyan.org) is also versatile enough such that other active networks, biological or artificial, could be simulated with a similar level of detail in comparison to its cytoskeletal applications, including self-organizing polymeric micelles [118], ParM polymerization mechanisms in bacterial mitosis [119], and many types of synthetic polymer gels.
