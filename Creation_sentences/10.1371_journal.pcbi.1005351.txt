We present ASPASIA (Automated Simulation Parameter Alteration and SensItivity Analysis), a cross-platform, open-source Java toolkit that addresses a key deficiency in software tools for understanding the impact an intervention has on system behaviour for models specified in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
ASPASIA, released under the Artistic License (2.0), can be downloaded from http://www.york.ac.uk/ycil/software.
To address the challenge of capturing and analysing biological interventions in SBML, we have developed ASPASIA (Automated Simulation Parameter Alteration and SensItivity Analysis), a freely available software package that is compatible with all versions and levels of SBML and that complements currently available SBML solver software and statistical packages.
ASPASIA is open source and available under the Artistic License (2.0).
