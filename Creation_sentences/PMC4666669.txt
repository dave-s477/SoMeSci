In response, we have created Wham (Whole-genome Alignment Metrics) to provide a single, integrated framework for both structural variant calling and association testing, thereby bypassing many of the difficulties that currently frustrate attempts to employ SVs in association testing.
Wham and all associated software are covered under the MIT License and can be freely downloaded from github (https://github.com/zeeev/wham), with documentation on a wiki (http://zeeev.github.io/wham/).
Wham clusters all the candidate breakpoints and rounds their positions to the nearest tenth base pair.
To do this, Wham should be run over a BAM file containing SVs that have been validated.
We also use Wham to identify biologically important structural variants in non-human data.
Wham and all associated software can be found on github (https://github.com/zeeev/wham), documentation is on the wiki (http://zeeev.github.io/wham/).
