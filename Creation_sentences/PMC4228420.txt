A public release of DCE@urLAB, together with the open source code and sample datasets, is available at http://www.die.upm.es/im/archives/DCEurLAB/.
In this section, the compartmental models implemented in the DCE@urLAB analysis tool are described.
Thus, an additional MRI model has been included in the DCE@urLAB application and is discussed later.
DCE@urLAB has been implemented in a flexible and modular way, so that the addition of new analysis models is straightforward.
A public release of DCE@urLAB, together with the open source code and sample datasets, is available at http://www.die.upm.es/im/archives/DCEurLAB/ and in Additional files [1] and [2].
