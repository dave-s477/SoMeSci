Here, we present a new web server-based tool, the Pipeline for estimating EPIStatic genetic effects (PEPIS), for analyzing polygenic epistatic effects.
The PEPIS is publically available at http://bioinfo.noble.org/PolyGenic_QTL/.
Motivated by the challenge presented by the tremendous computational demand associated with epistatic QTL mapping, we conducted a thorough investigation of the model developed by Xu et al. and re-implemented the model algorithm using C/C++, resulting in the development of a web server-based tool named PEPIS (Pipeline for estimating EPIStatic genetic effects).
We developed the PEPIS for rapid epistatic QTL mapping analyses.
The PEPIS pipeline, the source code and the test data are freely available at http://bioinfo.noble.org/PolyGenic_QTL/.
