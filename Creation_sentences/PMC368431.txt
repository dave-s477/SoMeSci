We present VisANT, an application for integrating biomolecular interaction data into a cohesive, graphical interface.
VisANT is a freely available, open-source tool for researchers, and offers an online interface for a large range of published data sets on biomolecular interactions, including those entered by users.
VisANT has been developed to provide interactive visual mining of biological interaction data sets.
VisANT is available at http://visant.bu.edu.
