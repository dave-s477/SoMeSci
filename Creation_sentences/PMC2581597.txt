Here we introduced PSICIC as a robust and generally-applicable computational method for automating the high-resolution quantitative analysis of cellular image data.
We have thus made available the source code, software, and documentation for PSICIC (see link at http://www.molbio1.princeton.edu/labs/gitai/), and encourage others to modify, expand, and adapt the software capabilities to suit their own applications.
The original images overlaid with the cell borders identified by PSICIC were manually verified to check for false positives.
We gratefully acknowledge Sidhartha Goyal and Kerwyn Huang for helpful discussions during the development of PSICIC and Gitai lab members for their assistance with experiments.
