Here we introduce MAGERI, a computational pipeline that efficiently handles all caveats of UMI-based analysis to obtain high-fidelity mutation profiles and call ultra-rare variants.
Here we introduce MAGERI (Molecular tAgged GEnome Re-sequencing pIpeline), a dedicated software tool that implements UMI tag extraction and processing routines, an assembly routine that groups sequencing reads tagged with the same UMI into consensuses, and consensus alignment and variant calling modules (Fig 1).
MAGERI is implemented in Java v 1.8 and is distributed as a single cross-platform executable JAR file [https://github.com/mikessh/mageri].
