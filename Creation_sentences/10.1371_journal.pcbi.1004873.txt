We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package CNVkit, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome.

We implemented CNVkit as a Python 2.7 software package comprising a command-line program, cnvkit.py, and reusable library, cnvlib.
CNVkit generates several kinds of plots using the software libraries Biopython [35], Reportlab (http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/) and matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org):
