Here, we addressed this by developing a web-based software tool, PhosphOrtholog (http://www.phosphortholog.com) that accurately maps protein modification sites between different species.
Here we describe PhosphOrtholog, a web-based application for mapping known and novel orthologous PTM sites from experimental data obtained from different species.
To this end, we have developed an automated web-based tool, PhosphOrtholog, which allows batch processing and mapping of large species-specific PTM datasets to compare overlap at a site-specific level.
Here we present PhosphOrtholog, a web-based tool providing cross-species mapping functionality for novel and known phosphorylation and other PTM sites quantified in independent MS-based experiments.
The web-tool can be accessed from http://www.phosphortholog.com/ using any typical web browser (except Internet Explorer).
In this study, we present PhosphOrtholog, a web-based tool, which allows mapping of both novel and annotated PTM sites across species for large MS-based phosphoproteomics datasets.
