We present Redirector, a new Flux Balance Analysis-based framework for identifying engineering targets to optimize metabolite production in complex pathways.
We compare the final set of flux values resulting from this Redirector optimization to fluxes resulting from the optimization for biomass.
The Redirector framework provides a new capability in modeling metabolic alterations, using the FBA objective.
To demonstrate its capacity to optimize challenging pathways, we have applied Redirector to the production of myristoyl-CoA, examining the highest growth parameter design as well as the dependency analysis of multiple designs.
The Redirector Package including operational software code and metabolic network model files used for this publication are available at https://github.com//bionomicron/Redirector.git.
