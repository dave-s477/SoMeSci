We have developed GEMINI (GEnome MINIng), a flexible software package for exploring all forms of human genetic variation.
Unlike existing tools, GEMINI integrates genetic variation with a diverse and adaptable set of genome annotations (e.g., dbSNP, ENCODE, UCSC, ClinVar, KEGG) into a unified database to facilitate interpretation and data exploration.
Whereas other methods provide an inflexible set of variant filters or prioritization methods, GEMINI allows researchers to compose complex queries based on sample genotypes, inheritance patterns, and both pre-installed and custom genome annotations.
GEMINI also provides methods for ad hoc queries and data exploration, a simple programming interface for custom analyses that leverage the underlying database, and both command line and graphical tools for common analyses.
We demonstrate GEMINI's utility for exploring variation in personal genomes and family based genetic studies, and illustrate its ability to scale to studies involving thousands of human samples.
We have therefore developed GEMINI (GEnome MINIng), a novel software package that integrates genetic variation in the VCF format [3] with both automatically installed and researcher-defined genome annotations into a unified database framework.
GEMINI is a freely available, open-source software package.
