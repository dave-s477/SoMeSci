Here we present a tool, Podbat (Positioning database and analysis tool), that incorporates data from various sources and allows detailed dissection of the entire range of chromatin modifications simultaneously.
Podbat can be used to analyze, visualize, store and share epigenomics data.
Podbat is open source software freely downloadable from www.podbat.org, distributed under the GNU LGPL license.
Podbat requires Java version 1.6 or higher.
We set out to develop an integrated computational tool, Podbat (Positioning database and analysis tool) for use on epigenomics datasets.
Podbat is open source software implemented as a desktop application in Java and can be freely and anonymously downloaded from www.podbat.org or as supplemental material accompanying this paper (Software S1).
Podbat is distributed under the GNU LGPL license.
