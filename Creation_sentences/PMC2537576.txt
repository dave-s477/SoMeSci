We developed ProteoLens as a JAVA-based visual analytic software tool for creating, annotating and exploring multi-scale biological networks.
We developed ProteoLens as a new visual analytic software platform for creating, annotating and analyzing multi-scale biological networks.
In the next several sections, we first describe ProteoLens implementation and then demonstrate how it can be used to enable multi-scale biological network-based research through three case studies.
ProteoLens is a standalone software tool written in Java programming language.
