We developed a software package, V-Phaser 2, for inferring intrahost diversity within viral populations.
We developed V-Phaser 2, a publicly available software tool (V-Phaser 2 can be accessed via: http://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/projects/viral-genomics/v-phaser-2 and is freely available for academic use) that enables the efficient analysis of ultra-deep sequencing data produced by common next generation sequencing platforms for viral populations.
We developed the V-Phaser 2 program that overcomes these limitations of V-Phaser [12].
