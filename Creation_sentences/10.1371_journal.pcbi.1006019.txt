To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM).
To address these issues we developed the interactive DREM (iDREM) tool that provides support for more data types and greatly improves the visualization allowing users to interactively query the reconstructed network.
iDREM is implemented using a combination of Java and Javascript.
The iDREM code and software, with an example input dataset and detailed instructions are available from GitHub (https://github.com/phoenixding/idrem).
