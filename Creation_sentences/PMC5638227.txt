To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns.
To address this challenge, we designed a general framework, named BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns.
We introduced the BeWith framework to identify multiple mutated modules displaying specific mutation patterns between and within modules.
