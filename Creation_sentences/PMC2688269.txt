The EpiGRAPH web service http://epigraph.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ enables biologists to uncover hidden associations in vertebrate genome and epigenome datasets.
With the development of EpiGRAPH, we have pulled together our experiences and established workflows from several studies [10,20-23] and incorporated them into a powerful and easy-to-use web service.
We developed EpiGRAPH to fill this gap, thereby enabling biologists to perform advanced bioinformatic analysis and prediction with little need for bioinformatic support.
EpiGRAPH was developed with this scenario in mind and prototypes software paradigms required for distributed genome analysis by concerted action of specialized tools.
EpiGRAPH facilitates reproducibility and data sharing by encoding all analyses in standardized analysis description files that can be re-run by other users.
