Chaste — Cancer, Heart And Soft Tissue Environment — is an open source C++ library for the computational simulation of mathematical models developed for physiology and biology.
Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular test-driven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability.
Cancer, Heart And Soft Tissue Environment (Chaste) has been developed to enable the study of novel problems in computational physiology and biology.
The example simulations can be run, and figures recreated, by downloading the associated Chaste project from http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download, as described in Text S1.
Chaste is written in C++, a compiled language that allows object-oriented class definitions.
At present Chaste can only be used with Linux, although it works well via a Linux virtual machine (using software such as VirtualBox) on a host running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X.
An independent analysis of Chaste development activity and code composition can be found at Ohloh (http://www.ohloh.net/p/Chaste) .
Chaste is developed using an ‘agile’ development methodology, using many features of eXtreme Programming (XP) [19].
Chaste is freely available to download from the website at http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste.
