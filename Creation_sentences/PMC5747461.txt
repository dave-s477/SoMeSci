MAGPIE, a Modeling and Analysis Generic Platform with Integrated Evaluation, closes this gap by providing a software platform for both, publishing and executing computational models without restrictions on the programming language, thereby combining a maximum on flexibility for programmers with easy handling for non-technical users.
We demonstrate the versatility of MAGPIE using four prototypic example cases.
Our platform MAGPIE addresses this issue by providing a single platform where researchers from different domains can publish, exchange and execute models on-line (Fig 1) as well as publish and exchange data.
MAGPIE was implemented in Ruby on Rails 5.
The MAGPIE source code can be downloaded from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/christbald/magpie and installed on any public or private server, as well as on any local computer.
