Here we present Pathomx, a workflow-based tool for the processing, analysis and visualisation of metabolomic and associated data in an intuitive and extensible environment.
Pathomx is released with a base set of plugins for the import, processing and visualisation of data.
Recognising the benefits that workflow-based analysis could offer to metabolomics analysis while hoping to overcome the limitations of batch-based processing, we developed Pathomx: a workflow-based tool for data analysis.
Pathomx is an open source and cross-platform analysis tool.
