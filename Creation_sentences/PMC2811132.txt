We present a bioinformatics solution (3PD) to support the experimentalist in detecting long-ranging intra or inter chromosomal contacts by Chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays.
In summary, our software 3PD facilitates genome-wide primer design for 3C experiments in a matter of seconds.
Our software is available as a web server at: http://www.pristionchus.org/3CPrimerDesign/.
Finally, we have introduced a web interface to our 3PD software and we have provided a runtime benchmark on real-world problem sizes.
Our software is freely available to academic users as a web server at: http://www.pristionchus.org/3CPrimerDesign/.
