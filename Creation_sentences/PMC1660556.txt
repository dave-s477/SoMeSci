Here we describe coXpress, an R package that allows researchers to identify groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed.
We have developed coXpress as a means of identifying groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed.
Here we describe coXpress, a simple and easy to use package that allows users to explore differential co-expression in an intuitive way.
CoXpress uses hierarchical cluster analysis to explore the relationship between genes, cutting the tree to form groups of genes that are co-expressed.
CoXpress is released as a package for R.
CoXpress is written in the native R language and has been fully tested on both windows and linux.
