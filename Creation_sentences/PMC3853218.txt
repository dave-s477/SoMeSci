We present a fast and user-friendly software platform called "cellXpress" to segment cells, measure quantitative features of cellular phenotypes, construct discriminative profiles, and visualize the resulting cell masks and feature values.
We systematically compared the processing speed, cell segmentation accuracy, and phenotypic-profile clustering performance of cellXpress to other existing bioimage analysis software packages or algorithms.
The cellXpress platform is designed to make fast and efficient high-throughput phenotypic profiling more accessible to the wider biological research community.
The cellXpress installation packages for 64-bit Windows and Linux, user manual, installation guide, and datasets used in this analysis can be downloaded freely from http://www.cellXpress.org.
Here, we present a new cell image analysis software platform called "cellXpress" for high-throughput phenotypic profiling.
We have implemented and optimized a seeded-watershed-based cell segmentation algorithm [2] for the cellXpress platform.
The cellXpress software package can be downloaded from http://www.cellXpress.org.
