We present Telescope, a computational software tool that provides accurate estimation of transposable element expression (retrotranscriptome) resolved to specific genomic locations.
Telescope is available at https://github.com/mlbendall/telescope.
Here, we introduce Telescope, a tool which provides accurate estimation of TE expression resolved to specific genomic locations.
We use Telescope to investigate the expression of HERVs in cell types from the ENCODE consortium.
Telescope is implemented in Python, is available as an open-source program under the MIT license, and has been developed and tested on Linux and MacOS.
