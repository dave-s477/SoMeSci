The VBA toolbox is then used to invert a “dynamical” variant of the Q-learning model (cf. section “Reinforcement learning models of choice data”), given the agent's sequence of choices.
In this paper, we have exposed the main algorithmic components of the VBA toolbox, which implements a probabilistic treatment of nonlinear models for neurobiological and behavioural data.
VBA's code is under open-source GNU General Public Licence (v2), and is freely downloadable from the toolbox's internet wiki pages (http://code.google.com/p/mbb-vb-toolbox/wiki/InstallingTheToolbox).
