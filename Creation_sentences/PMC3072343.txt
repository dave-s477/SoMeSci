We introduce MicroSyn software as a means of detecting microsynteny in adjacent genomic regions surrounding genes in gene families.
MicroSyn was designed for both experienced and non-expert users with a user-friendly graphical-user interface.
MicroSyn is available from: http://fcsb.njau.edu.cn/microsyn/.
We have developed a tool, called MicroSyn, to semi-automatically detect microsynteny within an individual gene family.
In particular, MicroSyn was designed for both experienced and non-expert users.
To demonstrate the utility and use of MicroSyn, we presented a case study of the evolution of miR167 gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Populus trichocarpa (Populus), Vitis vinifera (grape) and Oryza sativa (rice).
In this study, we took advantages of newly available whole genome resources, and developed a program, MicroSyn, a semi-automated tool, to provide an additional valuable means to address the problem intrinsic in the computational methods and sequence qualities themselves in gene family analysis.
MicroSyn is now implemented in C# on Windows platform.
