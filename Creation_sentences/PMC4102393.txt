To address the need for comprehensive, fully automated, and biology-driven analyses of C. elegans swim motion, we developed the program CeleST (C. elegans Swim Test), which accomplishes multi-animal tracking, measurement, and data analysis without need for investigator intervention.
CeleST can track multiple animals simultaneously (we use 5/drop but more are possible), and can import data from other trackers to score measures.
The CeleST software can be used as a platform, and with application-specific tracking methods and measures, other cellular or animal behaviors can be analyzed (sperm mobility, zebrafish swimming, etc.) for any application that can use video (mating, sleeping, feeding, foraging, etc.).
Overall, the CeleST program constitutes an accessible and comprehensive approach for C. elegans locomotory quantitation that translates analysis of complex swimming patterns to a new level of resolution and efficiency.
