All the unidentified and taxonomically identified bird specimens from Combe Grenal and Les Fieux were inspected for cutmarks using a stereomicroscope at low magnification. The cutmarks that we identified are unambiguous and fall well within the range of those documented in ungulate taxa [12]. The cutmarks are often deep and tend to show sharp boundaries typical of incision marks produced with a stone tool. The anatomical terms in this paper follow the nomenclature currently used in the analysis of bird remains.
